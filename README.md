# Neural-Networks---Image-Classification-Fun-Project
Applying Udemy coursework to a fun image classification project

I am applying techniques learned in the 1st course of the Deep Learning Specialization from Coursera/deeplearning.ai. 

These are shallow and deep neural networks focused on binary classification, using different activation functions. 

This project uses the methods learned in the class to classify an image as either a hotdog or not a hotdog.

The code could be applied to any other binary classification problem.

Data is obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/hot-dog-not-hot-dog/data.
